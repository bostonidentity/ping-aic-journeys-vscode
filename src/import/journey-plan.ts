/**
 * Inner-journey unit decision model for journey import (PD-3/4/5/6, model §3).
 * Pure: no client, no vscode.
 *
 * Every bundled tree is a flat unit (PD-4). Its decision is `Create / Overwrite
 * / Keep` (PD-5), driven by two facts:
 *   - **role** — `subject` (a root the user is importing) vs `inner` (referenced
 *     by some `InnerTreeEvaluatorNode.tree` of another bundled tree). Derived
 *     structurally from the bundle, never from meta (PD-18).
 *   - **verdict** — `new` (target lacks the tree) vs `exists` (target has it),
 *     from the pre-flight (`runPreflight` → existence-only, PD-5).
 *
 * Decision matrix:
 *   subject + new    → Create   (only action; you're importing it)
 *   subject + exists → Overwrite(only action; Keep = import nothing)
 *   inner   + new    → Create   (only action; caller needs it, can't Keep an absent tree)
 *   inner   + exists → Keep     (default; or Overwrite — pushing your copy clobbers
 *                                a shared journey, so Keep is the safe default)
 *
 * These are the smart DEFAULTS (TD-10) the UI (S8) seeds from and the executor
 * (S6) orders writes by; the user may switch an `inner + exists` row to Overwrite.
